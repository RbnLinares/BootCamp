# Exercise 1: Set

# my_fav_numbers = {2,5,8,16,69}
# my_fav_numbers.add(33)
# my_fav_numbers.add(88)
# print(my_fav_numbers)
# my_fav_numbers.remove(88)
# print(my_fav_numbers)

# friend_fav_numbers = {3,6,9,15}
# our_fav_numbers = my_fav_numbers.union(friend_fav_numbers)
# print(our_fav_numbers)

#Exercise 2: Tuple
#No, tuples are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, you cannot add or remove elements from it.

# Exercise 3: list
# basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
# basket.remove("Banana")
# basket.remove("Blueberries")
# basket.append("Kiwi")
# basket.insert(0, "Apples")
# apple_count = basket.count('apples')
# basket.clear()
# print(basket)

#Exercise 4: Float
# Is a number that can have a decimal point. 
# The difference between an Integer and a Float is: Integer is a whole number, without fractional
# component. It can be positive, negative or zero, and are represented by the int data type.
# on the contrary float is a number that can have a fractional component. It can be positive, 
# negative, or zero, and can include a decimal point. Floats are represented by 
# the float data type.

# start = 1.5
# plus = 0.5
# list = [start + i * plus for i in range(8)]
# print(list)

# there is another way to do it with something called "numpy" and "itertools" Library.

#Exercise 5: For Loop
# for i in range(1, 21):
#     print(i)

# for index, value in enumerate(range(1, 21), start=1):

# Exercise 7: Favorite Fruits

# Exercise 8: Who Ordered A Pizza ?
